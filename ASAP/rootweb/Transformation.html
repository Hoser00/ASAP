  Making the transformation into a sustainable way of living
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">OK, so you found your way onto the ASAP website, read and looked through some 
of the information and are beginning to think: “Hey, this “stuff” kind of makes some sense. But, I don't 
really understand this entire “sustainability concept,” as it is new and foreign to me. AND, I certainly 
don't know how to start trying to live in a sustainable way even if I decided to begin. I need some sort of 
'road map' or plan to look over to figure out how to undertake such a transition in my lifestyle.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">All right, I understand your reluctance and uncertainty diving right into a 
lifestyle that seems different from the way you are living today, but let me reassure you that it is not that 
different in many ways and not a hard or painful thing to do. In fact, if sustainability living is explained 
as it was in years past it may help you see that the concept is neither new, nor hard to embrace and use. It 
used to be the normal and natural way to conduct your life, and reviewing it may provide you with a loose plan 
or map of how you could proceed today. It's just that these practices of true sustainable living have been 
mostly lost over the years. Our forefathers used to refer to this type of lifestyle as 'self-reliant' or 
'self-sufficient'. As our nation has gone through the Industrial Age and rise to affluence, we have become 
very dependent on people and things other than ourselves. Now it is becoming ever so clear that this dependence 
is neither a good, nor a safe practice! 
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">I was fortunate enough when growing up to have had a number of years to enjoy 
my grandparents before they passed on. As a child and in my young adulthood, I often would question some of 
the things that my grandmother would practice or preach to us grandchildren when we spent time with her. 
Although she was actually pretty well off financially, she could be incredibly frugal with not only her money, 
but also food waste and many other things. Growing up in a time of plenty, I had a hard time understanding 
the effort she would put into “using everything up” or saving leftovers for later. In retrospect, it is easy 
to understand her motivation. She and my grandfather had been young adults during the time of The Great 
Depression and knew what it was like to have to “do without” while trying to raise a family. Those were grim 
times from what they told me and my grandmother was always quick to remind of us of how “good we have it 
today and how little we are thankful for it.” You and I have the luxury of being able to comfortably transition 
into a more sustainable, self-reliant manner of living without having it forced on us, at least for right now.

  Transformation steps
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Let's explore a thinking and planning process that will allow us to move 
towards our goal of living more sustain ably and self-sufficient by entertaining the following steps and 
thoughts:
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Step 1: <b>Recognize the value of your surrounding environment and people in 
it.</b> Understand that we have a moral obligation to make the proper choices to protect and enhance the value 
we have assigned to people and items that surround us.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Step 2: <b>Empower yourself to learn, evaluate and finally make informed 
decisions</b> on all the various aspects of your personal lifestyle and recognize the impact that those decisions 
will have in our world. In short, take full responsibility for yourself and your decisions. Much like hiring 
a contractor to do a job for you, or buying a product that you personally know little about, you talk to 
various knowledgeable or experienced people and get opinions and referrals before you make up your mind 
what you will do.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Once you have crossed this line of awareness and personal decision-making 
empowerment, the rest is actually easy. The level of sustainable living practices that you attain is for 
you alone to decide and make a consistent part of your life.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Step 3: <b>If you are a beginner at this sustainable living “stuff,” take some 
simple first steps.</b> Gradually you will grow and work to add new practices, as things seem to get easier 
and more comfortable to perform. If you have never really done any recycling, you could start by closely 
observing just what you and your family are throwing into the garbage can each day. Learn how this garbage 
accumulates and then multiply it by time and number of households in your town or city. It is staggering. 
This observation will lead you to take the first step to redirect recyclables out of your garbage stream 
and to a site for reuse. If your area has a Recyclables Pickup, perhaps just putting many of these items 
on the curb will be sufficient for a start. Maybe you will begin to see things that could be repaired 
rather than just thrown out and replaced with new. You might also begin to search out alternative products 
that aren't wasteful or have minimal packaging that can be recycled – not thrown out. This may ultimately 
lead you to start to question and reevaluate your spending/purchasing habits and balance that with your 
actual need for certain products and goods. In other words, “Why can't I live without this?”

  <p class="headline">
  Transformation to sustainable living is practical
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">As you begin seriously evaluating this sustainable living idea, you might 
want to consider what you and your family are eating, where it comes from, what it costs, and God forbid, 
just what you and your family would eat if there were some sort of breakdown in the delivery system used 
by our local supermarkets. Consider creating your own veggie garden. Some type of long-term food storage 
such as dehydrating or canning foods may seem like wise ideas to consider getting underway. This was one 
thing that
I remember well, my grandparents always had a back up of stored food and essentials for that “just in 
case” situation. Being prepared and self-reliant is prudent and fits right in with sustainable living 
practices. By now I think, if you have been instituting the above practices and ideals into your daily 
life, you will probably be seeing and feeling better about how your life is as well as noticing you have 
more of your hard earned money still left in your pocket at the end of the month! This segues perfectly 
into the following thoughts and actions you could consider and possibly embrace:
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">How you handle your personal finances and whatever monetary wealth you 
may have is also part of the process. If you can't help yourself, you are certainly not self-sufficient 
or living a sustainable lifestyle. Even worse, if you think the government will take care of you, you 
are in for a rude awakening! Seek out a local financial adviser that has a like mindset and values to 
help you map out a way to invest or spend your money to make a difference for your future. Also, providing 
services and products for the local area is important, but more important is shopping local and using 
local services and the labor of local, home-owned businesses is just as important. This strengthens the 
local economy; provides for the services you expect (fire protection, police protection and road 
maintenance to mention a few); and keeps your neighbors employed in decent-paying jobs. Now, THAT is 
sustainable living!
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">We can't leave energy out of this discussion. Energy is what powers every 
part of our civilization. The source of consumable energy has caused wars in many countries and is causing 
us, here in the USA, immense financial pain today. The more energy efficient you can become, the better 
off you and your community will be. So living a sustainable lifestyle would encompass things such as 
replacing home appliances and systems with the most energy saving and efficient items you can find on the 
market. Making sure your home is well insulated and as energy efficient as possible. Finding ways to 
conserve energy and perhaps even looking at ways to produce power (solar, wind, etc.). Planning and 
connecting numerous stops into a single trip to town for shopping and errands will, unbelievably save a 
lot of energy as well as your time!
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">WATER. We haven't even touched on how important water is. It takes an 
incredible amount of energy to get water to our faucets. It takes even more, a tremendous amount more 
energy, to deliver hot water to our taps. There are many new products out there now that help with saving 
and heating water. Living a sustainable lifestyle is taking our water supply and conservation of it very 
seriously and actually doing something about it! Besides REAL conservation of water, what about considering 
rainwater capture from your roof for watering your yard or veggie garden? What about limiting the 
'hardscaping' around your home and on your property as well as careful drainage control to allow water 
to stay on your property and soak into the soil where practical so that the ground water is recharged 
rather than all of the surface water running off into storm drains and being carried off with out any 
value to our ground water table.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">As you can see, living in a “sustainable” way can include many, many actions 
and considerations. Can any of us possibly embrace all of them; I doubt it. But, if we all try to do what 
we can, to do the best of our personal ability in those regards, I'll guarantee you that it will make a 
tremendous difference in all of our lives, AND, you WILL be living a sustainable lifestyle! I wish you 
well on your quest for that very promising and rewarding lifestyle!
