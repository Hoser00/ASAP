  <p class="headline">
  How do we get from Here to There?
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">As we enter the second decade of the second millennium, our country, as well as 
the rest of the world, 
appears to be hopelessly hooked on the internal combustion engine to power the vehicles we need to transport 
both us, and our goods/products, from one place to another. Powering transportation and equipment with 
internal combustion engines has been an incredibly inexpensive (in the grand scheme of things) and reliable 
method to accomplish our transportation and ‘heavy work load’ needs and has powered us at speed into and 
through the industrial transformation of our country, as well as much of the rest of the world also. The 
problem with this form of transportation is that it requires the burning of oil to power these engines, 
and that is where the ‘rub’ comes in.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Until recently, oil was a fairly inexpensive commodity that most of us didn’t 
give much thought to unless the price of a gallon of gas increased, at which time we would probably grumble 
and say a few choice words, but then just reach a little deeper into our pockets and pay the increased cost. 
Now, however, it is becoming increasingly more apparent that oil and oil-powered vehicles/equipment are the 
source of many adverse issues we as a society are facing today. These adverse issues run the gamut from 
creating wars to obtain and/or control oil to pollution of our precious environment to the financial weakening 
of our Country and we ourselves. There are those that claim that the burning of fossil fuels is the cause 
of the climate change (aka global warming) that we are experiencing. Now, I’m not smart enough of a person 
to determine whether oil and the burning of fossil fuels IS the cause of climate change, or, whether it is 
just another cycle in the earth’s history of temperature and weather patterns that has fluctuated since the 
beginning of time. I’m going to have to leave that argument to the ‘enlightened’ and ‘esteemed’ politicians 
and scientists that have ‘locked horns’ over that subject. But, what I do feel pretty confident in saying 
is that we DO NEED to make a fundamental change in the forms of energy we utilize to provide us our 
transportation and that do our ‘heavy’ work. 
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">The painful truth, at least to me, a person who grew up revering the automobile, 
is that we no longer can afford the cost of oil; our environment can’t tolerate the pollution and we need to 
eliminate our dependence on foreign oil for our Countries security and economic equilibrium. I also believe 
that the notion that we can exploit “vast” American oil reserves that are contained in oil shale deposits or 
off shore reserves is a myth due, if nothing else, just the tremendous expense and use of energy needed to 
extract the oil from these hard to reach locations. I feel pretty confident in making such a statement, if 
for no other reason, than a man such as T. Boone Pickens, a person who has made billions of dollars in the 
oil business, is now heavily promoting other forms of energy use for our Country other than oil.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">At this point in time, I’m not exactly sure what our transportation will look 
like in the future and what will power it, but I do believe it will be way different from what we have today. 
There finally appears to be a huge opportunity for inventers and entrepreneurs to develop and bring to market 
alternative forms of power and transportation, which I think was to at least some extent, squelched by big 
oil in the past. I also believe that a “mechanic” in this coming new world of transportation and various 
propulsion methods will take on a new importance and will need to have skills and knowledge in many fields. 
I envision a future repair shop that employs mechanics that would be able to repair any thing from a bicycle 
to an all-electric powered vehicle. With the proper promotion, preparation and education, this could be a 
huge opportunity for our youth to learn and enter a field that will be of great importance and provide a 
decent income. There is even greater opportunities as I mentioned previously for those that attempt to find 
new, more efficient and clean sources of power and how to utilize those energy sources in vehicle and 
machinery propulsion, as I just can’t foresee a time when man won’t have a need and want to travel from one 
place to another or need machinery to do our heavy work.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Moving towards and embracing new cleaner methods of transportation utilizing 
renewable energy sources begins to take on a whole new ‘look’ if you think about it. It just plain makes 
sense in so many ways. To employ these new forms of energy and transportation as soon as we can will bring 
our Country and us as a people to the point that we have almost lost, and that is being self-reliant, 
self-sufficient and living a life in a more sustainable way. Let’s move forward together by putting pressure 
on our elected officials, schools and industry to do what is right and in our Countries and worlds best 
interest by supporting and promoting new forms of energy and transportation. Let’s break the destructive oil 
addiction NOW!
