  Raw water, the source of treated water
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">For the last 50 years, we have experienced a huge growth 
in population in California and there 
is an incredible need for more water, especially in the exploding southern portion of the State. Unfortunately, our 
large farming complex that exists in the Central valley seems to be getting forgotten in the water wars. Diversion of this 
precious water out of the Sacramento Delta to 
try and ‘quench’ this insatiable thirst of the south is now causing ecological disaster to the Delta areas as 
salt water from the San Francisco Bay can now back-up into areas that fresh water flow would keep the salt 
water literally at bay in the past. This situation has reached a ‘boiling point’ politically and many powerful 
‘special interests’ are squared off and wrestling with each other for the upper hand in controlling this water.
  </p>
  <p>Farmers use raw water, not treated water to grow crops. In fairness to Southern California, counties like Ventura, 
have invested in raw water distribution systems with distinctive purple colored pipe. When you see purple pipe and sprinkler
heads, you know that conservation is a value to the agency or company that operates that system. Raw water is the best 
choice for watering landscapes since it can accommodate both untreated source water and reused secondary or tertiary 
treated wastewater. Secondary treated wastewater can be used for growing food, but can only be applied to the roots, 
and not the parts consumed. Also, no body contact is allowed with wastewater treated to secondary standards. Without
using raw water and reusing treated wastewater, the demands on treatment and distribution systems would be unsustainable.
More urban areas will need to adopt policies that support higher levels of water reuse. Otherwise, the green and growing
California we knew will be a thing of the past as thirsty people take water from every corner of the state.

  Water Rights
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">What is incredibly unbelievable and unfair is, at least for those of us living 
in Tuolumne County, we have no rights to the rain and snow that drops on our County! Our drinking water comes 
completely from ground wells or water that our local water agencies must purchase from P. G. & E. under periodically 
renewing contracts that are NOT guaranteed renewable! Somehow, in the early 1900’s, San Francisco was able to 
wrest the water rights away from our County. This is a true travesty of justice, especially when realizing the 
majority of the water used in San Francisco and what flows into the Delta originates here in Tuolumne County. 
when we have a dry period and a drought occurs, we Tuolumne County residents must ration our water use while the 
San Francisco area continues life as usual watering their lawns and watching the excess run down the gutters. 
With the water ‘war’ heating up in Sacramento over more water removal from the Delta, the idea that we Foothill 
and Mountain people just have to conserve our water use to allow more water to be flowing to the Delta has begun 
being bantered about at some of the Capitol meetings. Outrageous is all I have to say!
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">There is a movement started, although in its somewhat stumbling initial stages, 
to try to find a way to recoup those lost water rights. Whether this will ever come to fruition is anyone’s guess. 
So, in my opinion, we have to be prudent and plan for the worst, which would be that some, or maybe even severe 
water restrictions will be levied on us, especially those getting their water from the local Utility Districts 
because of their exposure to onerous State water regulations. However, I feel there is another side to this issue 
that is, in my mind, just as compelling although from a different aspect. Before the modern development of the 
California foothills and the Sierras, rain and snow water that hit the ground would soak into the ground. Trees, 
shrubs, grasses and natural ground covering mulch from these growing ‘things’ covered and protected the soil 
surface from extremes of heat and cold, kept the water present from evaporating quickly and provided an incredible 
habitat for all sorts of organisms, insects and rodents that made the eco-system thrive. Besides this big thing 
that the mulch and plants provided, it also held water in place longer allowing it to soak into the soil and help 
replenish the ground water supplies. Now, with large developed areas that have ‘hard surfaces’ comprising and 
surrounding them (roads, parking lots, roofs, driveways, patios, etc.), rainwater is shed and directed into drainage 
conveyances of different kinds. This ‘shedding’, redirecting and allowing water to run rampant downhill results 
in erosion, sedimentation of our streams, lakes and other waterways as well as the loss of adequate ground water 
replenishment activity.

  How can you use raw water?
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">If you have access to raw water sources, such as wells or purple pipe, use them in
preference to treated water for watering landscapes. If you are growing food, be sure that your raw water does not 
contain secondary treated wastewater. Otherwise, be sure none of the irrigation water touches the edible portions of 
the plants. And don't let kids play in it.  
  </p>
  <p>The major concern regarding raw water is the potential for cross-connections
between treated water and potentially contaminated water. Backflow prevention devices are essential equipment under
conditions where sources of contamination could enter the treated water system. Not only is it a risk for you, but it
is a risk for everyone else connected to the treated water system. A cross-connection could make hundreds of people sick
and some could die.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">It is quite safe to use raw water and treated wastewater if proper care is used.
It is important to be certain that appropriate plumbing is installed with backflow prevention devices. You can help
conserve our most precious resource by supporting laws and regulations that promote and facilitate use of raw water 
and appropriate wastewater reuse.
