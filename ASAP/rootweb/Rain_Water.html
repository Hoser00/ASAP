  Rain water, the main source of treated water
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">The process of capturing and collecting rainwater for domestic potable uses as 
well as for irrigation is far from a new idea. In some portions of the world, collected and stored rainwater 
is the only real source of drinking water, and has been going on for centuries. For those of us living here 
in the foothills and the Sierra Mountains, attempting to install such a system seems almost like a bad joke. 
Why would anyone want to go to such an amount of work and expense when we have so much water available from 
normal precipitation and yearly snow pack melt? Actually, there are several very compelling reasons why we 
need to start seriously thinking about embracing just such a water supply system.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">When raw water is not available, and well water is not practical, rain water can 
be captured for later use.
  </p>
<p style="text-indent:20px;">As larger urbanized areas are developed that have ‘hard surfaces’, such as roads, 
parking lots, roofs, driveways, patios, etc. Rainwater is shed from these surfaces and directed into drainage 
conveyances of different kinds. This ‘shedding’, redirecting and allowing water to run rampant downhill results 
in erosion, sedimentation of our streams, lakes and other waterways as well as the loss of adequate ground water 
replenishment activity.

  What does rainwater capture mean to you?
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">So, what does all of this have to do with rainwater capture and use? Well, quit a 
bit actually. First, it is a horrible waste of time energy and chemicals to be watering our yards and gardens 
with treated and/or clean drinking water! Second, if water conservation and/or rationing is to be imposed on us 
for some reason, there will be NO water available to water our yards and gardens from normal water sources. 
Third, despite the first two compelling reasons, why aren’t we embracing rainwater collection and use for no other 
reason than to be allowing water to be spread on the basic soil area that it fell on, allowing it to soak into 
the ground and hopefully replenishing the ground water supply? Seems like a ‘no-brainer’ to me!
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">The components and installation of a rainwater recovery and use system can range 
from fairly simple all the way to very complex systems. What is the right choice for your situation is, as always, 
something that takes a little thinking, planning and probably some consultation with people familiar with these 
types of systems, as well as a close check of what you have to spend. However, simple systems can be as easy to 
get started on by just buying a barrel and a few rain gutter downspout components to direct the rainwater into 
the barrel. One of the best ‘generic’, but very informative explanations of rainwater capture systems, how to 
decipher what you may need to install such a system and what their components may consist of comes from Oregon 
State Building Codes Division: 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbs.state.or.us/external/bcd/pdf/3660.pdf" class="link">Rainwater Harvesting</a>
 [.pdf].
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">I hope that this information spurs you to look further into this subject and possibly 
think seriously to institute such a simple water saving system on your property.
