<h3>THIS SUSTAINABLE LIVING “THING,” WHAT’S IN IT FOR ME?</h3>
<p style="text-indent:20px;">
OK, so you find yourself on the ASAP (A Sustainable Approach Program) website for whatever reason. Of course you’ve heard of ‘green’ products and practices and you’ve probably even heard the word ‘sustainable’ bantered around to some extent. But just what does all this mean and why should you even have a slight bit of interest in all of this? In other words, you ask yourself: What’s in it for me?
</p>
<p style="text-indent:20px;">
Actually, that is a legitimate question and not nearly as self-centered or self-serving as it seems at first glance. If living life in a sustainable manner means changing our daily living practices to differ somewhat from the lifestyles common today, then yes, it becomes a very relevant question. Any person contemplating making a change in their life needs some sort of motivation to do so, and usually it is a powerful reason. Otherwise, it is just human nature to just ‘go with the flow’ and do things as we’ve always done. This is especially true if what “we’ve always done” seems to be pain free and effortless. However, there really is no such activity as pain free when it comes to living practices, as for every cause/action there is always a reaction/result.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:20px;">
What in the heck am I talking about? Well, let’s take our currently accepted method for our food sources and procurement. We climb into our car, drive to the supermarket, walk through the isles and isles of refrigerated, packaged and/or displayed goods picking up what we want, and then paying for and transporting the food and goods home in bags in our cars. Seems pretty simple and straightforward until you break that activity down into pieces to really understand what is actually occurring.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:20px;">
First, have you ever thought about where that produce comes from, how it was grown and finally how it got to the grocery shelf? A lot of the vegetables and fruits we find in the supermarkets are grown in areas many miles from where we live. Some of the produce even comes from countries continents away! Much of this produce is picked/harvested way before it’s ripe, bought in bulk and shipped in refrigerated containers. This produce lacks many of the natural proponents, vitamins, and taste that are found in a healthy ripened food.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:20px;">
What would happen if we were to buy our food from local producers? Well, there would be no real transportation costs or hassles. The food would be fresher, and in the case of produce, it would be ripe and healthier and tastier. The Pain: Give up the no blemish and no bruises mentality. There would be little or no packaging needed. And, our money would stay local where it would strengthen our local economy. What a win-win!
</p>
<p style="text-indent:20px;">
What if you were to learn to grow your own veggies in your own garden? What if you began composting your table scraps and yard debris and started using it to replenish the nutrients in the soil of your vegetable garden and plants? There are many, many other activities that you could undertake that are sustainable practices that will save you money and allow you and your family to live a more rich and healthy life. The fact that these actions also help the environment doesn’t hurt either! That’s just a small part of “what’s in it for you.”
