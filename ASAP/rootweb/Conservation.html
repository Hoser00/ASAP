  Conservation: Introduction
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">I bet that if you asked fifteen people what water conservation means that you would 
get fifteen totally different answers. I say this not because water conservation is a tough subject to understand, 
but because there really has never been a true concerted effort by any group or organization that I can remember 
that has attempted to truly teach and promote water conservation. Conserving water always seems to be a knee-jerk 
reactionary program hastily put in place due to a sudden awareness of a drought or other water shortage situation. 
However, I think that all is about to change in a big way when it comes to the subject of water. Clean, safe water 
to drink, wash with and use for cooking needs is beginning to be a very important subject with increased monetary 
values being applied to waters’ delivery to our homes.

  The problem today
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">What is fueling this increased awareness of the importance and value of clean water 
is not just the huge increase of the world’s population that needs clean water to live, but the fact that we humans 
are polluting many sources of our water. It is an alarming fact that certain ingredients of medicines/pharmaceuticals 
are now being found in water sources. Acid rain and certain petroleum and pesticide residues are also adversely 
affecting some of our water sources. All of these issues provide big hurdles for the adequate supply of clean water 
for our use. So using the clean water we do have wisely starts making a lot of sense. Maybe water conservation starts 
taking on a whole new importance, meaning and plan to institute.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Up ‘till now, conserving water normally meant installing low flow shower heads, 
minimum flush toilets, minimum or time controlled watering of lawns and/or landscape, no hosing down of paved surfaces 
and minimal or no washing of cars. These and other water conserving practices are indeed good. But note that expensive 
and needed potable drinking water is still being used for many activities that don’t require that quality of water. 
Maybe we need to rethink and re-evaluate what conserving water should really mean and what sort of activities need to 
be included in water conservation. Very likely we need to begin identifying water sources that allow us to perform the 
cleaning and watering activities we need to accomplish without the use of clean, potable water. Now that would be water 
conservation!

  What we can do
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Conserving water, at least in my mind, is a multi-faceted program/project. There are 
things that each of us can do ourselves given the time, energy and money, and, some that the local and regional water 
providers could do. Can you imagine the value of having a second pipe (referred to as ‘purple pipe’) plumbed to each 
home and business that carried raw, untreated water that could be used for such activities as landscape watering, 
vehicle washing, etc.? This second water supply could not be connected in any manner to the potable water system, but 
imagine the savings of the water in the ‘clean’ water system! This system of dual water delivery would also allow the 
integration of other water conserving processes such as use of rainwater capture systems, diluted use of reclaimed 
water sources because the clean, potable water is out of the ‘purple pipe’ system completely.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">True water conservation wouldn’t end with what we’ve discussed so far. In fact, our 
imagination would be the limit. What if we designed and contoured our yards and landscaping in a manner that caused 
rainwater that fell on our property to stay on the property and soak into the ground, thus helping replenish the ground 
water storage? What if we limited the ‘hardscaping’ (concrete or asphalt driveways, patios, walkways, etc.) around our 
homes and buildings and provided open seamed surfaced areas that allowed water absorption into the ground? As you can 
see, water conservation can encompass many different activities and ideas. My thought is that we will all have to start 
seriously looking at the various aspects of true water conservation sooner than later as water is becoming a huge issue 
that will have to be dealt with before most of us will be ready for the changes that will be forced on us.
