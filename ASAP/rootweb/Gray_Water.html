  A Gray Water Discussion
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Every time water conservation comes up in a discussion, almost invariably 
the use of grey water is brought up. And for good reason, as grey water appears, at first glance, to be 
a huge waste of what seems would be still very useable water. But, as with many things in life there is 
another whole set of issues that make the use of grey water a very real concern, in fact a big possible 
health hazard. Let's take a look at what grey water actually is before we start even thinking of how we 
could possibly use it in some way.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">I'm sure there are better descriptions of what grey water is, but my 
understanding is that grey water is the waste water that comes from the use of the sinks, showers, tubs 
and clothes washing machine of a home or other structure. Waste/waste water from toilets and urinals is 
considered "black" water or waste. Black waste/water is very unsanitary, and if allowed to flow to the 
surface of the ground where people, animals or vegetation is contacted by it, serious infections and/or 
diseases can result. One of the issues with grey water is, that, if it is collected and allowed to stand 
for about 24 hours, it too can turn into black water and become a health hazard. This, then, is one of 
the major hurdles that must be overcome in order to put grey water to some positive use.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">Two sources of possible grey water origination are particularly troublesome, 
but are also the source of a large percentage of the grey water that we would find desirable to collect 
and make use of. One is the kitchen sink wastewater, but it can be the source of Salmonella and other 
harmful bacteria. The other is the clothes washing machine, but it can be the source of E. coli 
(Escherichia coli) and other pathogens. It is these very reasons that grey water cannot be stored for 
any real length of time, as these substances will turn the grey water into hazardous black water. It 
is also for this very reason that Environmental Health Departments are so negative about the installation 
and use of grey water systems.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent:20px;">The reality of the situation, however, is that we just have to start giving 
the use of grey water systems more serious attention as we begin to be aware more and more of the shortage 
of clean potable water. We just can't be using precious drinking water for yard and garden uses. So we 
must come up with other sources of water, and grey water seems like a likely candidate. But wait! Now we 
have another issue besides the health issue that we have to overcome. Those people that are on a septic 
type waste system may not be as affected by the redirection and use of the grey water from their waste 
plumbing system, but our local sewer treatment Departments have a whole different concern and viewpoint 
concerning the removal of grey water from the sewers. The reason for that is that they then will lose 
the liquid that is used to carry the solids down the sewer pipes to the treatment plants. Nothing is ever 
easy! I feel there is a solution and I am personally attempting to find some sort of system design that 
will allow at least some grey water use, but I think it will also have to incorporate other sources of 
water at the same time. If you have any ideas, please share them. Otherwise, 'keep tuned' as I will share 
whatever plan/design that surfaces and gets the Enviro-Health Departments approval.
