  Just what does alternative energy mean?
  </p>
  <p>
  Throughout human history, it’s been energy in various forms that has allowed the human race to make 
the leap from the Stone Age to the present day comfortable life style. Energy has lead to the advance 
of some countries over others, and has also been the underlying cause of conflicts between competing 
countries. Until just a few years ago, energy was pretty much just taken for granted, as inexpensive 
fossil fuels were abundant and cheap and used almost exclusively to supply our various energy needs. 
However, now that reality has set in and we are coming to the understanding those fossil fuels are 
indeed limited in quantity, polluting our environment and ever increasing in cost, sources of energy 
other than fossil fuels are being embraced and brought ‘on line’ to help provide our ever increasing 
energy needs.
  </p>
  <p>
  So, to answer the question of “What does alternative energy mean?”, I guess we could say that 
alternative energy is energy sources that do not have direct adverse effects on our environment 
or disposal issues that ‘traditional’ energy sources do such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy. 
However, even this description could be controversial as well as what forms of ‘alternative energy’ 
sources are included in the category. We will list all forms of energy producing products, suppliers, 
services and installers that we can identify that fit the above description so that you can decide 
for yourself which is best suited to your individual needs. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Our listing will also feature an area where you can rate the performance and quality of the various 
alternative energy products and services listed that you have purchased. This valuable input will help 
many others that are looking to purchase products or hire installing Contractors to adequately compare 
and make an informed decision before parting with their hard earned money. Please take the time to enter 
your comments on products or services that you have bought so that others can benefit from your experience. 
We do want you to tell us about your good as well as not so good experiences with the products and 
companies/Contractors involved with that product that you have used. If you have a negative experience, 
we only ask that you keep your comments civil and centered on the actual facts. We will have to review 
the comments in case distasteful comments are made that are inappropriate for a public forum such as this 
site is. We will do our best to provide you with as many product service choices as we can as time goes along.
