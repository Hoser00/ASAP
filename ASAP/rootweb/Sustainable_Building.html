  JUST WHAT IS A ‘GREEN’ BUILDING PRODUCT OR A<br />
     GREEN/SUSTAINABLE CONTRACTOR OR BUSINESS?

  </p>
  <p>
  That word ‘green’ is so over used today! In fact, it’s been so over used I seriously doubt there is 
any kind of consensus as to what a ‘green’ anything actually is today. Originally, ‘green’ was meant 
to infer a product or practice that was ecologically good or sensitive positively to the environment. 
At the outset, ‘green’ was a decent, short and easy description of a product or practice that took the 
environment into consideration and tried to make little or no impact negatively on it. As awareness of 
the environments fragile condition became more apparent and the ‘green’ movement began to gain momentum, 
the inevitable occurred as always does in our capitalist style of economy when people see the opportunity 
to ‘cash in’ on what many people are embracing. Thus became the demise of the word ‘green’ to describe an 
ecologically sound practice or product, at least in my mind. Today, it seems as if every thing is touted 
as ‘green’ by manufacturers and providers even though many either aren’t at all ‘green’ or are only 
remotely so. This false advertising and practice of referring to products or services as being ‘green’ 
when they really aren’t is referred to as ‘green washing’. 
  </p>
  <p>
  As you can see, ‘Green’ can mean many things to many different people. A ‘green’ product or service 
in its purest sense should include all of the following considerations and probably a few others that 
I can’t think of right now:
  </p>

<ol type="a">
  <li> Will 'it' save energy?</li>
  <li> Did it take a minimal amount of energy to produce?</li>
  <li> Was 'it' produced, harvested or manufactured locally?</li>
  <li> Is the material 'it' is made of renewable?</li>
  <li> Can 'it' be recycled?</li>
  <li> Was 'it' manufactured out of recycled material?</li>
  <li> Are the by-products and waste of manufacturing process used productively for something?</li>
  <li> Was 'it' produced using fair labor practices?</li>
  <li> Is 'it' healthy (toxic off-gas, known human carcinogen, etc.)? </li>
  <li> Is 'it' durable so that it won't have to be replaced often?</li>
  <li> Is the product socially acceptable and useful?</li>
</ol>

  <p>
  I think that this list points out how many considerations it would take to evaluate and proclaim a product 
or service as being truly ‘green’. On the other hand, however, we humans have need for certain products that 
don’t readily conform to the above criteria and they still could be considered ‘green’ to some extent because 
the manufacturer is doing everything in their power to conform to those eco-friendly standards during every 
level of the manufacturing process starting right at the time the raw material is obtained. In the end, it 
is the level of care and involvement undertaken to leave as little a ‘foot print’ as possible that is what 
counts.
  </p>
  <p>
  A.S.A.P. will not rate any of the products or services as being ‘green’ that are listed here on this site. 
The reason is that we don’t feel that we should be the sole ‘judge and jury’ of any product as it is you, the 
end user who’s opinion counts. Please take the time to enter your comments on products that you have bought 
so that others can benefit from your experience. We do want you to tell us about your good as well as not so 
good experiences with the products and companies involved with that product that you have used. If you have 
a negative experience, we only ask that you keep your comments civil and centered on the actual facts. We 
will have to review the comments in case distasteful comments are made that are inappropriate for a public 
forum such as this site is. We will do our best to provide you with as many product choices as we can as time 
goes along.
