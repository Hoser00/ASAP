  What is 'GREEN WASHING'?
  </p>
  <p>
  That word 'green' is so over used today! In fact, it's been so over used I seriously doubt 
there is any kind of consensus as to what a 'green' anything actually is today. Originally, 
'green' was meant to infer a product or practice that was ecologically good or sensitive 
positively to the environment. At the outset, 'green' was a decent, short and easy description 
of a product or practice that took the environment into consideration and tried to make little 
or no impact negatively on it. As awareness of the environments fragile condition became more 
apparent and the 'green' movement began to gain momentum, the inevitable occurred as always 
does in our capitalist style of economy when people see the opportunity to 'cash in' on what 
many people are embracing. Thus became the demise of the word 'green' to describe an ecologically 
sound practice or product, at least in my mind. Today, it seems as if every thing is touted 
as 'green' by manufacturers and providers even though many either aren't at all 'green' or 
are only remotely so. This false advertising and practice of referring to products or services 
as being 'green' when they really aren't is referred to as 'green washing'.
