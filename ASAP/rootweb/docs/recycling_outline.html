  RECYCLE/WASTE MANAGEMENT ‘LIFE STYLE CHANGE’<br />THE ASAP PLAN
  </p>
  <p>
STEP ONE – easy “go’in” start:<br />
<ul>
<li> Newspapers</li>
<li> Aluminum cans</li>
<li> Plastic bottles/containers</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
STEP TWO – easy addition to above:<br />
<ul>
<li> Magazines</li>
<li> Glass container</li>
<li> Plastic shopping bags</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
STEP THREE – just a little more effort:<br />
<ul>
<li> Use your own cloth bags when shopping</li>
<li> Recycle your engine oil &amp; used filter</li>
<li> Buy only what you really need</li>
<li> Buy durable, repairable products</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
STEP FOUR – come on, you can do it:<br />
<ul>
<li> Compost kitchen (proper) scraps</li>
<li> Repair old items and use them again</li>
<li> Purchase products in refillable or reusable containers</li>
<li> Buy fresh produce from local farms</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
STEP FIVE – you’re one waste management/recycling machine now!<br />
<ul>
<li> Think before making any purchase, and buy local</li>
<li> Consider finding and buying what you need at second hand stores</li>
<li> Become an advocate – write manufacturers to change packaging, talk to store owners to carry products that create less waste, etc.</li>
<li> Re-evaluate what you own, what you actually use and really need</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
STEP SIX – sky’s the limit………..<br />
<ul>
<li> Make it a personal challenge to understand what it is that you are purchasing, from who and what exactly you will do with that product and packaging from the time you bring it to the cash register all the way to the time ‘it’ (whatever is left of ‘it’) leaves your hand for the last time.</li>
<li> By practicing recycling and waste management, you have become an example – teach your children and family well! They all will live a richer life for it!</li>
</ul>
